[progress_notification]
percent: 20
#   This is an interval in percent, when a notification with a picture is sent to the chat.
#   When set to 5, notifications are sent at 5%, 10%, 15%, etc.
#   When set to 3, notifications are sent at 3%, 6%, 9%, etc.
#   The default is not to send notifications based on print percentage.
#   This value should be an integer >=0.
#height: 0.0
#   This is an interval in mm, when a notification with a picture is sent to the chat.
#   When set to 5.0, notifications are sent at 5.0mm, 10.0mm, 15.0mm, etc, print height.
#   When set to 0.25, notifications are sent at 0.25mm, 0.5mm, 0.75mm, etc, print height.
#   The default is not to send notifications based on print height.
#   This value should be an float >=0.0.
#time: 0
#   This is the recommended way to use progress notifications.
#   This is an interval in seconds, when a notification with a picture is sent to the chat.
#   When set to 600, notifications are sent at 600 seconds, 1200 seconds, 1800 seconds, etc, print time.
#   When set to 100, notifications are sent at 100 seconds, 200 seconds, 300 seconds, etc, print time.
#   The default is not to send notifications based on time.
#   This type of notifications continues, even when the print is paused. So if your printer triggers a pause, for example 
#   caused by filament runout, you will still get notifications regularly, until the print is completed/canceled.  
#   This value should be an integer >=0.
#groups: group_id_1, group_id_2, group_id_3:thread_id
#   When running multiple printers/a farm, you may want to aggregate all notifications from all printers in a group.
#   You can also use threads inside the group. Fastest way to get group/thread ids is to copy a link to a message inside a thread.
#   You can enter group IDs here, to which notifications will be sent. No control from a group is possible.
#   Bots send start/status print updates, errors, messages from Interacting-with-klipper#send-custom-notifications-to-the-bot to the group.
#   Telegram group IDs are negative integers. Thread IDs are short integers.
#group_only: false
#   If you are using the group feature, you might want to disable individual notifications and use group notifications only.
#   Set this to true to disable individual notifications in individual chats.
#   This value should be boolean.

[telegram_ui]
eta_source: slicer
#   You can choose, which value to use for remaining time estimation.
#   Default value is slicer.
#   Allowed values: slicer, file
#buttons: [status,pause,cancel,resume],[files,emergency,macros,shutdown]
#   You can redefine, which buttons and in which position you want displayed.
#   If this is not defined, the default order is used. Buttons are defined per row, each row separated.
#   This allows you to add your own custom macros to the bot's keyboard as well. 
#   Add or replace default bot commands with "/%macro_name%. The macro listed in this section
#   should be defined in klipper config files, in UPPERCASE. Maximum macro name length is 54 chars.
#   This value is not validated automatically.
#require_confirmation:
#   This list contains commands (or macros) which will trigger an additional confirmation in chat before executing.
#   You can either list specific g-codes, macros and bot commands, or use meta-groups "gcodes", "macros", "commands" to list all types respectively. 
#   Default is "logs, logs_upload, shutdown, restart, cancel, fw_restart, emergency, reboot, power, bot_restart".
progress_update_message: true
#   Every time status gets updated, a notification message is sent, that the progress status has been updated.
#   It gets deleted after the next status update is triggered. Setting it to false will not send notifications on progress updates.
#   Default is false.
#   This value should be boolean.   
#silent_progress: false
#   If progress_update_message is set to true, setting this to "true" sends the printer status change without an alert. 
#   You still get a "red" notification. Sadly the bot API does not permit sending "grey" completely silent messages. 
#   There is no way to work around that. 
#   Default is false.
#   This value should be boolean.
#silent_commands: false
#   Sends all other messages (for example the emergency stop confirmation) without an alert.You still get a "red" notification, 
#   but it does not have sound or vibration.
#   Sadly the bot API does not permit sending "grey" completely silent messages. There is no way to work around that. 
#   Default is false.
#   This value should be boolean.
#silent_status: false
#   Sends the printer status change (error, idle etc.) without an alert. You still get a "red" notification, 
#   but it does not have sound or vibration.
#   Sadly the bot API does not permit sending "grey" completely silent messages. There is no way to work around that. 
#   Default is false.
#   This value should be boolean.
#include_macros_in_command_list: true
#   This enables in-chat autocomplete for macros. 
#   Default is true. 
#   Telegram can not handle autocompletion for commands longer than 32 symbols. Macro names which exceed this length will not get autocompleted.
#   This value should be boolean.
#hidden_macros: macro1, macro2
#    If you have macros displayed in the auto-complete list, you may want to hide specific ones.
#   Default is not to hide any macros.
#   This value is not validated automatically.
#hidden_bot_commands: bot_restart, cancel, video
#   You may want to hide specific commands of the bot from the auto-complete list.
#   Default is not to hide any commands.
#   This value is not validated automatically.
#show_private_macros: false
#   You can decide to show service macros prefaced with a "_" in the autocomplete list.
#   Default is to hide and not autocomplete these macros.
#   This value should be boolean.
#status_message_m117_update: false
#   If you want, you can trigger a status update on the m117 command.
#   Default is not to trigger an update.
#   This value should be boolean.
